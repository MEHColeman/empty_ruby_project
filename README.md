# Plain Ruby Project Template

This project is a template for creating a plain ruby (non-rails) project with
some useful defaults.

Clone this project into your desired directory and run `bin/setup`
~~~
~/projects>hub clone MEHColeman/empty_ruby_project new_thing
~/projects>cd new_thing
~/projects/new_thing>bin/setup
~~~

This will:
  * Configure some stuff
  * Run some code generators to set up a default testing framework
  * Tidy up the generated code
  * Create a new, clean git repository with a single initial commit of your new
    files.
